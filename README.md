new new website!!


## new implementations
added some new designs to the previously basic designs i had integrated into my website.

for one, the new design is *VERY* wes anderson-inspired, with centered text and special visuals that i made in adobe illustrator.

there are also way more javascript animations, including swup page transition integration and scrollreveal for the home page. scrollreveal is also available on all pages (save for the contact page, which consists solely of a hero section), but doesn't execute when changing pages - i am working on fixing this! no worries. either way, i think this design is much cleaner and user friendly - i even managed to make a nicer mobile version! yay!
